# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#

board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
shield: [ "mykeyball_left", "mykeyball_right" ]
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: mykeyball_left
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: mykeyball_right
